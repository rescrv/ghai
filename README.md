ghai: advancements to the gh command
====================================

ghai-mark-read:  Selectively mark a notification as read.  This tool will mark notifications as read
when they seem to come from a push event.  I care about comments, new PRs, new issues, and merges.

ghai-my-issues:  My preferred output for browsing issues.  Clean and easy to navigate from the
terminal.
